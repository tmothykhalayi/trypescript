# TypeScript Learning Repository

## Description

This repository contains my personal learnings, notes, and experiments with TypeScript. It's a collection of various concepts, code snippets, and practice exercises that I use to improve my understanding of TypeScript.

The goal is to explore TypeScript's features, understand its strengths over JavaScript, and apply it in different contexts.

## Topics Covered

Here are some of the key topics Iâ€™ve worked on:

- **Type System**: Types, Interfaces, Type Aliases, Generics
- **Classes and Objects**: Classes, Constructors, Inheritance
- **Functions**: Function Signatures, Overloading, Arrow Functions
- **Modules**: Import/Export, ES6 Modules in TypeScript
- **Async Programming**: Promises, async/await
- **Type Inference and Type Checking**
- **Decorators** (Experimental)
- **Other Topics**: Namespaces, Type Assertions, Enums
- OOP CONCEPTS
